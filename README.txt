Hackerrank Tasks 

• Problems 1  and  4 were not very much of a hurdle

•In problem 2, it took me some time to find the secondary diagonal, because it was not having the simple general index form (a,a) like primary diagonal elements 

• But in problem 3, there was an extra space coming to the left of the "#" in the final row
I solved it by using string concatenation 

• in problem 5, it took me some time to get why I wasn't getting the right output for 12:00:00Am, then I had to add an exception case for it.

Codeforces Tasks 

These tasks were a bit more interesting than the ones before .

•Problem 2 could be managed by adding strings and finding lengths of strings 

•Problem 3 in particular took some time, because I couldn't figure out at once how to count through ranks through an array of scores in descending order . 

•In problem 4 I had to make a bunch of functions to make it simpler

Project Euler

•Problem 1 wasn't much of a bump

•But in problem 2, generating Fibonacci numbers until a given "upper limit" instead of an "nth" term made it a bit challenging.
